# Book Rental Backend

The Book Rental API is a production-grade RESTful backend built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides a complete system for user authentication, book listing, and book rental management. Designed with real-world use cases in mind, this API simulates a scalable and secure online book rental platform

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Many people have books they donâ€™t use often. Others want to read those books without buying them.  
This API lets users **share their books**, **search available books by city or title**, and **rent them for a small fee** â€” all through a secure and scalable backend.
